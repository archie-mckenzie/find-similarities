"Spartianus on the contrary side, sheweth an example quit opposite to this, and this it was: during the Empire of Claudius, there died a certain Roman called Pamphilus, who as was clearly proved, had not in all his life time spoke one true word, but wholly delighted in lying and flattery: for which cause the Emperor commanded that his body should be left unburied, his goods should be confiscate, his house overthrown, and his wife and children banished Rome, to the end that the memory of a creature so venomous, should not live and have residence in his Commonweal."

"It is not enough for a man to be free of this vice, but he must also fly and sequester himself from the fellowship of those which are possessed with that foul and inveterate Error, For, it is commonly seen, when a man would bring out a sudden Lie, to give it the more credit, he will avouch his friend for a witness, saying: he knows it, and was present with me."

"This friend is continually attended and accompanied with four of his brethren, Lightness of mind, Vain Joy, Singularity, & Defense of a mans sins: Lightness of mind teacheth him to presume, Vain Joy swelleth him with temporal prosperities, Singularity makes him affect innovations to please, Defense of his sins groundeth him in his own mischiefs; This sin is the only perverter of friendship, and disturber of society, and unhappily saith Tully is that possession good,* which is purchased by simulation & flattery: so that great cause had both the fathers and Philosophers to detest this sin, because they knew that man is naturally apt to flatter himself, and is best pleased to hear his imperfections dissembled."

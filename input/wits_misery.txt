Another Devil of this age (and the son of Leviathan) is Adulation, who goes generally jetting in Noblemen’s cast apparel, he hath all the Sonnets and wanton rhymes the world of our wit can afford him, he can dance, leap, sing, drink up-se-Frise, attend his friend to a bawdy house, court a Harlot for him, take him up commodities, feed him in humors; to be short, second and serve him in any villainy: If he meet with a wealthy young heir worth the clawing, Oh rare cries he, do he never so filthily, he pulls feathers from his cloak if he walk in the street, kisseth his hand with a courtesy at every nod of the yonker, bringing him into a fools Paradise by applauding him; If he be a martial man or employed in some Courtly tilt or Tourney, Mark my Lord (quoth he) with how good a grace he sat his horse, how bravely he brake his lance: If he be a little bookish, let him write but the commendation of a flea, straight begs he the copy, kissing, hugging, grinning, & smiling, till he make the young Princox as proud as a Peacock. This Damocles amongst the retinue caries always the Tobacco Pipe, and his best living is carrying tidings from one Gentlemans house to another: some think him to be a bastard intelligencer but that they suspect his wit is too shallow. This is as courtly an Aristippus as ever begged a Pension of Dionisius, and to speak the only best of him, he hath an apt and pleasing discourse, were it not too often sauced with Hyperboles and lies: and in his apparel he is courtly, for what fool would not be brave that may flourish with begging? The sword of a persecutor woundeth not so deeply as he doth with his tongue. Neither doth the voice of a Siren draw so soon to shipwrack as his words: yet (as Aristotle and Cicero think) he is but a servile fellow, and* according to Theophrastus, he is an ant to the grain of good nature: Of all things he cannot abide a scholar, and his chiefest delight is to keep down a Poet, as Mantuan testifieth in these verses:*
Est & apud reges rudis, invida, rustica turba.
Mimus, adulator, leno, assentator, adulter,
Histrio, scurra quibus virtuuu odiosa poetas.
 Mille modis abigunt: ut quand cadavera cerni.
Invenere, fugant alias volucresque ferasque.
There is in Princes and great mens courts (saith he) a rude, envious, and rustic troop of men, jesters, flatterers, bauds, soothers, adulterers, players, and scoffers, who hating all virtue find a thousand inventions to drive Poets thence, like to carrion crows, that having found a carcass, drive all other birds from it: and as the Coluber (as Ovid saith) always seeketh and* haunteth the cleanest Dovecoat, so this flattering Devil is still conversant in the house of the mighty: and as in the fattest ground grows the rankest grass, so with the men of greatest ability dwelleth the chiefest flattery (S. Jerome calls him a Domestical* enemy.) This Κoλaxia,  as the Greek terms it, hath but little difference from ravening, for if we believe Caeleius Rodeginus, & Erasmus in his Apophthegmes, the only changing of a letter, will make Corachas & Colachas crows & flatterers all one. Alexander meeting with this Devil in the person of Aristobulus, conjured him quickly, for as Politian writeth on Suetonius, he not only scorned his flatteries, but cast his Chronicles into the river of Hidaspes, telling him that he deserved no less, who had so fabulously handled his victories: had Herod done no less when the Tyrians called him God, his pride had not been notified to the world; neither strooken by an Angel, should he have been devoured by worms. This friend is continually attended and accompanied with four of his brethren, Lightness of mind, Vain Joy, Singularity, & Defense of a mans sins: Lightness of mind teacheth him to presume, Vain Joy swelleth him with temporal prosperities, Singularity makes him affect innovations to please, Defense of his sins groundeth him in his own mischiefs; This sin is the only perverter of friendship, and disturber of society, and unhappily saith Tully is that possession good,* which is purchased by simulation & flattery: so that great cause had both the fathers and Philosophers to detest this sin, because they knew that man is naturally apt to flatter himself, and is best pleased to hear his imperfections dissembled. The ancient Emperors desirous to avoid this error, and to banish this poison from their palaces, sought out the wisest men to be their Counselors, who most of all detested this vice, as Salomon who was advised by Nathan and Sadoch: Carolus Pius the Emperor, by learned Alcuinus: Trajan the just, by learned Plutarch: Nero the unjust, by grave Seneca: Alexander (though a conqueror) by ingenious Aristotle: Ptolemy of Egypt, by the 70 interpreters. To conclude therefore the discourse of this Devil, I will end with two notable actions of the Romans, whereby you may perceive by them, to make estimation of truth, and to grow in detestation of Flattery and Falsehood: The Emperor Augustus in his triumph over Anthony and Cleopatra, led to Rome (amongst his other spoils)* a grave Egyptian Priest of sixty years old, whose life was so full of continence, and words so stored with truth, that it was never heard of him in all his life time that he had told untruth, or used flattery; for which cause it was concluded by the Senate, that he should presently bee set free, and made chief Priest, commanding (that among the statues of famous and renowned men) one in especial should be reared for him. Spartianus on the contrary side, sheweth an example quit opposite to this, and this it was: during the Empire of Claudius, there died a certain Roman called Pamphilus, who as was clearly proved, had not in all his life time spoke one true word, but wholly delighted in lying and flattery: for which cause the Emperor commanded that his body should be left unburied, his goods should be confiscate, his house overthrown, and his wife and children banished Rome, to the end that the memory of a creature so venomous, should not live and have residence in his Commonweal. In which two things Messia useth this observation, that in the time that these first effects happened, the Romans were mortal enemies of the Egyptians, for which cause it may easily bee seen how powerful the force of truth is, since the Romans raised a statue to their Enemy, and deprived their homeborn son and Citizen of burial for being a flattering liar: Hitherto he, and here conclude I the description of this fiend. … 

The first by Sathan (his grandsire) was called Hate-Virtue, or (in words of more circumstance) Sorrow for another mans good success) who after he had learnt to lie of Lucian, to flatter with Aristippus, & conjure of Zoroasts, wandered a while in France, Germany, & Italy, to learn languages & fashions, & now of late days is stolen into England to deprave all good deserving. And though this fiend be begotten of his fathers own blood, yet is he different from his nature, & were he not sure y• Jealousy could not make him a cuckold, he had long since published him for a bastard: you shall know him by this, he is a soul lubber, his tongue tipped with lying, his heart steeled against charity, he walks for the most part in black under colour of gravity, & looks as pale as the Visard of the ghost which cried so miserally at the Theater like an oyster-wife, Hamlet, revenge: he is full of infamy & slander, insomuch as if he ease not his stomach in detracting somewhat or some man before noontide, he falls into a fever that holds him while supper time he is always devising of Epigrams or scoffs, and grumbles, murmurs continually, although nothing cross him, he never laughs but at other mens harms, briefly in being a tyrant over mens fames, he is a very Titius (as Virgil saith) to his own thoughts.
Titij{que} vultur intus
Qui semper lacerat comest{que} mentem.
The mischief is that by grave demeanor, and news bearing, he hath got some credit with the greater sort, and many fools there be that because he can pen prettily, hold it Gospel what ever he writes or speaks.

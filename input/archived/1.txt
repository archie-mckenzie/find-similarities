This is a presentation of the research done by Herodotus from Halicarnassus. Its purpose is to ensure that the actions of people are not forgotten over time, and to preserve the amazing achievements of both the Greeks and non-Greeks. This includes understanding the reasons behind their conflicts with each other. 
The Persian scholars believe that the Phoenicians started the conflict. They say that the Phoenicians came from the Red Sea and settled in the area they still live in today. They began making long trips, trading Egyptian and Assyrian goods in various places, including Argos, which was the most important city in what is now called Greece. The Phoenicians arrived in Argos and started selling their goods. About five or six days later, when most of their items were sold, many women, including the king's daughter Io, came to the shore to shop. Both Persians and Greeks agree that Io was the daughter of Inachus. While the women were looking at the goods and negotiating prices, the Phoenicians decided to attack them. Most of the women managed to escape, but Io and some others were captured and taken aboard the ship, which then sailed to Egypt. 
The Persians say that Io's arrival in Egypt happened differently than the Greeks' version, and according to them, this was the first wrongdoing. They continue by saying that some Greeks, whose identity they don't know but were likely Cretans, went to Tyre in Phoenicia and kidnapped the king's daughter, Europa. At this point, both sides had committed one wrong each. However, the Persians claim that the Greeks were responsible for the next offense. They say that the Greeks traveled by ship to Aea, a city in Colchis, and to the Phasis River. After completing their mission there, they kidnapped the king's daughter, Medea. When the Colchian king sent a messenger to demand compensation for the kidnapping and the return of his daughter, the Greeks refused, saying that since they hadn't received any compensation for the abduction of Io from Argos, they wouldn't give any to the Colchians. 
The Persians continue their story by saying that a couple of generations later, Alexandrus, also known as Paris, who was the son of King Priam, heard about these events and decided to kidnap a wife from Greece, believing he wouldn't be punished for it. So, he took Helen. The Greeks initially planned to send messengers to demand Helen's return and compensation for her abduction. However, when they proposed this, the Trojans brought up the kidnapping of Medea and reminded the Greeks that they were demanding compensation from others while not offering any themselves, nor returning what they had taken. 
The Persians believe that up to this point, both sides were only guilty of kidnapping. However, they argue that the Greeks were more at fault because they invaded Asia before the Persians attacked Europe. The Persians think that kidnapping women is wrong, but trying to take revenge for it is foolish, as wise people would ignore such matters. They believe that the women wouldn't have been taken if they didn't want to be. The Persians themselves didn't react to the kidnapping of their women, but the Greeks, in response to the abduction of a woman from Lacedaemon (Sparta), gathered a large fleet, invaded Asia, and destroyed King Priam's kingdom. Since then, the Persians have considered the Greeks as their enemies. They see Asia and its inhabitants as their own, while they view Europe and the Greeks as separate from them.
